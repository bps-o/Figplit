# Figplit snippet library

These snippets are high-fidelity building blocks the Figplit agent can reference when composing new landing pages. Each file is written in TypeScript + React and leans on Tailwind/Uno utility classes and framer-motion for motion choreography. The agent can copy, remix, or adapt them directly.

## Available snippets

- `glass-hero-orbits.tsx` – Glassmorphism hero with gradient orbits, two CTA buttons, and layered blur accents.
- `metrics-marquee.tsx` – Auto-scrolling marquee for logos and success metrics with gradient edge fades.
- `device-rail.tsx` – Responsive showcase rail with animated device cards and synchronized autoplay.

Add more snippets here to expand the agent’s vocabulary. Reference paths from prompts using `/snippets/<file-name>.tsx`.
